here you will find:
1) wav & ad4 files;
2) talking altimeter source code
3) spec which components are inside this green box;
4) arduino libraries.


I built this helmet-mounted talking barometer mostly to hear at which altitude I am flying my paraglider. my eyes are busy and my ears do not do anything! Instead of looking at my vario I want just hear a number.

I know my device is not perfect. If you need a perfect one (talking altimeter for yourself) just talk to me... do you want it voice activated? with a loud speaker instead of whispering like on the video? beeping like a vario? measuring and telling your vertical speed (climb and sink rate) in numbers? more precise and less inertious? solar powered? that's easy! :) you can build it yourself or I think I can build it for you :) just leave a comment and I'll contact you

cheers!
